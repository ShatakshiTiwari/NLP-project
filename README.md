A Natural Language Processing project on "Detection and Translation of Idiomatic Sentences " 

The project addresses the formidable task of accurately identifying and translating idiomatic expressions from Hindi to English within the realm of machine translation. 

Existing systems like Google Translate often falter in conveying the nuanced figurative meanings embedded in idioms, thus impeding effective translation. 

To tackle this, the study embarks on using different approach for identifying idioms in Hindi sentences, discerning their figurative nature apart from literal meanings. Additionally, the project emphasizes the significance of preserving the figurative meanings of idioms during translation to ensure accurate representation in English without solely relying on literal translations. Through manual assessment of translation outputs, the project aims to ensure contextually sound translations of idioms in English.

Furthermore, it explores the potential expansion of the idiom translation system to other language pairs to enhance overall translation capabilities. 

The project's key steps involve detecting Hindi idioms using approaches like N-grams and Sequence Matchers, and fine-tuning translation models such as IndicTrans. Challenges encountered during pre-processing, including handling contractions and dataset limitations, underscore the complexity of the task. Despite efforts, the XLMRoberta model failed to yield results, possibly due to issues like class imbalance. These endeavors and challenges collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies involved in idiomatic translation and the ongoing efforts to overcome them.
